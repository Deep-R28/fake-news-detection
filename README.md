This web application uses Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) to detect whether a given news headline or sentence is fake or real.
The model is trained on thousands of real-world news headlines using a combination of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and LSTM, along with GloVe word embeddings for meaningful text representation.


Working of Website:
1. Add the suitable title of the news and check, if it is true or false.


Concepts behind the code:
1. I have collected the dataset.. after making it fetch, I have removed the unnecessary columns.
2. Created the Neural Networks
3. Used Tokenization method for model to understand sentence, untill and unless it is in form of integers. For that , i have made word indexes, made a sequence arrangement and added padding to make each line of matrix in same length.
4. I made the model to understand the vocabularly for each word , so that if the user adds the synonym of the word , which is present by dataset, it could recognise it and detect it
5. After training, fitting and testing, I have predicted with few titles and worked well



Hope to create more projects in the field of Deep Learning, Machine Learning, NLP and these fields to explore myself in real world problems.
